## ✨ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Custom useDebounce Hook** ✅

**File:** `src/hooks/useDebounce.ts` (32 lines)

A reusable, generic TypeScript hook that debounces any value with a configurable delay.

```typescript
export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number = 300): T;
```

**Features:**

- Generic type support for any value type
- Default 300ms delay (as per requirements)
- Proper cleanup of timeouts to prevent memory leaks
- Documented with JSDoc comments
- No external dependencies (uses React hooks only)

### 2. **Enhanced Token Dropdown** ✅

**File:** `src/components/TokenDropdown.tsx` (132 lines)

Complete redesign of the token selection dropdown with search functionality.

**New Features Added:**

- **Search Input Field** - Positioned at top of dropdown with:
  - Search icon for visual clarity
  - Placeholder "Search tokens..."
  - Clear button (X) that appears when typing
  - Auto-focus when dropdown opens
  - Smooth keyboard navigation

- **Debounced Filtering** - Only filters after 300ms pause:
  - User sees typed text immediately
  - Actual filtering happens after 300ms of inactivity
  - Prevents lag from continuous filtering
  - Perfect for future API integration

- **Enhanced UX** - Better user experience:
  - "No tokens found" message when search has no matches
  - Search clears when dropdown closes
  - Selected token highlighted in filtered list
  - Case-insensitive search
  - Proper focus management

### 3. **Documentation** ✅

**File:** `DEBOUNCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (223 lines)

Comprehensive implementation guide covering:

- Technical architecture
- Code quality metrics
- Testing checklist
- Performance analysis
- Future enhancements
- Usage examples

## 📋 Requirements Met

✅ **Requirement 1: Add search field at top of Token Select modal**

```tsx
<div className="border-b border-slate-700 p-3 sticky top-0 bg-slate-800">
  <Search icon at left />
  <input placeholder="Search tokens..." />
  <Clear button (X) at right when text entered />
</div>
```

✅ **Requirement 2: Implement custom useDebounce hook**

```tsx
const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(searchInput, 300);
```

- Custom implementation (no external libraries needed)
- 300ms delay as specified
- Proper TypeScript typing

✅ **Requirement 3: Delay filtering by 300ms**

```tsx
const filteredTokens = useMemo(() => {
  return tokens.filter((token) => token.toLowerCase().includes(debouncedSearch.toLowerCase()));
}, [debouncedSearch]);
```

- Filters only after 300ms pause
- Prevents lag on every keystroke
- Optimized with useMemo

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management

```typescript
const [searchInput, setSearchInput] = useState(''); // Immediate input
const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(searchInput, 300); // Debounced value
```

### How Debouncing Works

1. User types → `searchInput` updates immediately (visual feedback)
2. Timeout starts counting (300ms)
3. If user continues typing → timeout resets
4. When user stops for 300ms → `debouncedSearch` updates
5. `filteredTokens` recalculates → component re-renders
6. Dropdown shows filtered list

### Performance Optimization

- **Before:** Filter runs on every keystroke (potentially 10+ times per second)
- **After:** Filter runs max 1-2 times per second (after 300ms pause)
- **Result:** Smooth, lag-free search experience
