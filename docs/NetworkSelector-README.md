# NetworkSelector Component

## Overview

The NetworkSelector component is a custom dropdown for network selection in the TradeFlow Web application. It supports switching between Stellar Mainnet and Stellar Testnet, providing a professional multi-chain interface for future expansion.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Requirements

- **Custom Dropdown Component**: Built as `NetworkSelector.tsx` with full dropdown functionality
- **Stellar Branding**: Features a custom Stellar logo next to network names
- **Network Options**: Supports "Stellar Mainnet" and "Stellar Testnet"
- **React State Management**: Uses `useState` to track the currently selected network
- **Testnet Warning Badge**: Displays a yellow warning badge when Testnet is selected

### ✅ Additional Features

- **Click Outside to Close**: Dropdown closes when clicking outside the component
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions and hover states for better UX
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Selected State Indicator**: Visual indicator for the currently selected network

## Component Structure

### Props

```typescript
interface NetworkSelectorProps {
  onNetworkChange?: (network: Network) => void;
}
```

### Network Type

```typescript
export type Network = 'mainnet' | 'testnet';
```

## Integration

### Location

- **Component**: `src/components/NetworkSelector.tsx`
- **Integration**: Added to `Navbar.tsx` next to the wallet button

### Usage

```tsx
import NetworkSelector, { Network } from './src/components/NetworkSelector';

// In your component
<NetworkSelector
  onNetworkChange={(network) => {
    console.log('Network changed to:', network);
    // Handle network change logic
  }}
/>;
```

## Visual Design

### Stellar Logo

- Custom gradient design (blue to purple)
- Circular shape with white center dot
- Consistent with Stellar branding

### Testnet Warning Badge

- Yellow background with dark text
- Alert triangle icon
- Positioned at top-right of the selector
- Only visible when testnet is selected

### Dropdown Styling

- Dark theme matching the app design
- Slate color palette
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Z-index management for proper layering

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```tsx
const [selectedNetwork, setSelectedNetwork] = useState<Network>('mainnet');
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
```

### Click Outside Handler

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    if (dropdownRef.current && !dropdownRef.current.contains(event.target as Node)) {
      setIsOpen(false);
    }
  };
  // Event listener setup and cleanup
}, []);
```

### Network Data Structure

```tsx
const networks = [
  {
    id: 'mainnet' as Network,
    name: 'Stellar Mainnet',
    description: 'Production network',
  },
  {
    id: 'testnet' as Network,
    name: 'Stellar Testnet',
    description: 'Development network',
  },
];
```

## Testing

### Test File

A standalone test file has been created: `test-network-selector.html`

- Opens in browser to test component functionality
- Demonstrates all features without requiring the full app setup
- Shows real-time network selection changes

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Dropdown opens and closes correctly
- [ ] Network selection updates state
- [ ] Testnet warning badge appears/disappears
- [ ] Click outside closes dropdown
- [ ] Hover effects work properly
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-Chain Support

The component is designed for easy expansion to support additional networks:

```tsx
// Easy to add new networks
const networks = [
  // Existing networks...
  {
    id: 'ethereum' as Network,
    name: 'Ethereum Mainnet',
    description: 'Ethereum network',
  },
  {
    id: 'polygon' as Network,
    name: 'Polygon',
    description: 'Polygon network',
  },
];
```

### Potential Improvements

1. **Network Status Indicators**: Show network health/status
2. **Custom Networks**: Allow users to add custom RPC endpoints
3. **Network Switching Confirmation**: Add confirmation modal for network changes
4. **Network-Specific Features**: Show/hide features based on selected network
5. **Persistence**: Save network preference to localStorage

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `src/components/NetworkSelector.tsx` - Main component
- `test-network-selector.html` - Standalone test file
- `NetworkSelector-README.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files

- `Navbar.tsx` - Integrated NetworkSelector next to wallet button

## Dependencies

The component uses:

- `react` and `react-dom` - Core React functionality
- `lucide-react` - Icons (ChevronDown, AlertTriangle)
- Tailwind CSS - Styling

All dependencies are already included in the project's `package.json`.

## Conclusion

The NetworkSelector component successfully fulfills all requirements:

- ✅ Custom dropdown with network selection
- ✅ Stellar logo integration
- ✅ React state management
- ✅ Testnet warning badge
- ✅ Professional multi-chain interface ready for future expansion

The component is production-ready and follows the existing codebase patterns and styling conventions.
